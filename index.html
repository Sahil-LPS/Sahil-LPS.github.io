transforms itself into educational inequality. </i></font>

make their way to a successful and wealthy life. And finally in

from a child’s home, it is not feasible for them to commute there
everyday. This reduces their accessibility to education. The United
Nations reports this as a large issue in Africa, where facilities are
not distributed equally (or at least, somewhat equally) amongst
communities.</font><img src="7fe3a21c3309419923287530a34e6948_html_151108a675251aa3.png" name="image3.png" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="12" width="284" height="189" border="0"/>

particularly, schools are funded locally by property taxes. This
inherently causes problems when schools in wealthier areas receive
more funding. Federally and equally funding schools eliminates this
issue. Lindsey Cook from US News reports that this unequal funding
results in racial segregation in the school system, where minorities
are more likely to attend poorly </font>

4: </b></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">As previously
mentioned, the 3.6 billion poorest individuals in the world have the
same wealth as few select wealthy individuals (Human Journey, part of
the Institute For Study Of Human Knowledge). Taxing the rich, who
already have such a large abundance of funds, could help fund public
schools without cutting funding from other areas.</font></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>Right
5: </b></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">If the wealthy have
the option to send their children to private schools, they will not
be concerned with the performance of public schools and will direct
their funds towards private schools. If the wealthy are forced to
send their children to public schools, they too will be concerned
about whether public schools are teaching properly and performing
well – meaning that the issue of poor quality education is more
likely to become noticed.</font></p>

<p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><b>Right
6: </b></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Private
after-school tutoring is inequitable in that not everyone can afford
it. Wealthy children can use private after-school tutoring to get
ahead, leaving other students behind. By abolishing after-school
tutoring, parents of wealthy students will be forced to advocate for
a higher quality education system that is self-contained. China in
particular has already started doing this. Pressenza, from the
Independent Media Institute, reports that China has banned for-profit
tutoring, as they believe the profits the tutoring  system makes off
pupils is unethical.</font><img src="7fe3a21c3309419923287530a34e6948_html_f43fc03e1ae09677.png" name="image4.png" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="12" width="449" height="225" border="0"/>

7: </b></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">In Latin America, a
lack of trained teachers remains a problem. Without enough trained
teachers, students simply cannot learn. In many countries, education
is put on the backburner, while really it needs considerably more
attention. FOCALPoint, an NGO, reports on this problem in Latin
America, but similar trends can be seen in other developing
countries. </font><img src="7fe3a21c3309419923287530a34e6948_html_4e9b0b45a63aad9.png" name="image2.png" align="left" hspace="12" vspace="12" width="359" height="251" border="0"/>

8 &amp; 9: </b></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif">In China in
particular, the Independent Media Institute reports that the country
has a  “two-track system,” in which a student can either receive
free education from the state, and do poorly on standardized tests,
or pay high fees to enroll in a private school. This system is
evident across the world. Public schools need to deliver the same
quality of instruction as private schools, and this right endeavors
to do so by forcing free education to meet certain standards.</font></p>
